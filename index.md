## Welcome to STpedia

Spatial Transcriptomics is an overarching term for a range of methods designed for assigning cell types (identified by the mRNA readouts) to their locations in the histological sections. This method can also be used to determine subcellular localization of mRNA molecules. The term is a variation of Spatial Genomics, first described by Doyle, et al., in 2000 [1] and then expanded upon by Ståhl et. al. in a technique[2] developed in 2016, which has since undergone a variety of improvements and modifications.[2]
